### **PROFESSIONAL PROFILE**
I specialize in Advanced Analytics (mix of exploratory data analysis, predictive and prescriptive analytics leveraging techniques 
across areas like statistical modeling, machine learning, data mining, text analytics). In the past years, I have played 3 critical 
roles, 

- Data Scientist - Develop statistical models using Machine Learning Algorithms for Predictive Analytics 

- Business Intelligence Analyst - Build dashboards using MS Excel and come up with actionable insights 

- Process Improvement Analyst - Improved the existing process flow by 40% reduction in time and there by ₹5M savings, 
using DMAIC principle in Six Sigma, leveraging tools like Minitab and Excel. 


### **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**
_EY GBS, Bengaluru |2018-present|_ 
_IBM India Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru |2016-2018|_

**Global IT Service – Customer Experience Analytics** 

_Advanced Analytics and Insights_ 
Works closely with Global IT leadership in consulting and delivering products that can help leadership taking better 
decision. This involves real time analytics, notifying , root cause analysis using various data science and visualization 
techniques. Real time machine diagnostic dashboard is created to monitor PC performance of employees across globe.  

**Client Performance Analytics**   
_Identify customer/client segmentation_  
Created a client performance analytics dashboard including various Financial KPIs in Power BI using Alteryx designer 
as the ETL tool. These KPIs were used to score different clients in terms of performance. These KPIs were also used to 
cluster clients into different groups to formulate efficient strategy.

**IT Ticket analysis and root cause analysis**  
_Identify key trends and insights from short description and other details_  
Worked on text details of every tickets to bring out key insights and trends by leveraging techniques like NLP, text  
similarity, topic modelling like LDA and NMF. Trend analysis of each topic of tickets was carried out in Power BI.  

**Study on Impact of WFH during lockdown – Text Analytics using R , Python and Power BI** 

_Identify the challenges faced by employees while working from home_  
Survey data from employees was taken to study on the challenges and the applications that are affected while working  
from home. Topic Modelling was carried out to identify key topics in the survey. Word cloud and sentimental analysis  
was carried out for initial understandings  
Identify the impact of COVID-19 in terms of productivity, volume of tickets raised as technical error.  
Worked closely with incident management team to find root causes on highly impacted incidents. Text classification,  
NLP, impact analysis along with Time series analysis and Association rule mining was carried out to identify top factors  
effecting outage or technical errors 

**Resume Screening**  
_Predict whether the given resume would clear the first level of walk-in interview_ 
NLP approach to breakdown the problem into a classification problem . TF-IDF and USE embedding was used to 
vectorize each resume. Later SVM was used to classify the resumes. 

**EY AI Challenge**  
_Predict top 5 most relevant answers for each question, from the paragraphs in US Tax Guide_ 

Built an information retrieval model with a MAP of 0.81 to pick the most relevant answers from the US tax law book for 
the input question. An ensemble model of TF – IDF + BM25 ranking with word embedding + cosine similarity was used 
for information retrieval 
Secured the AI Challenge Silver badge , Ranked under top 10 from India 

**Attrition Prediction : HR Analytics**  
_Predict attrition of employees in a financial year for BMC-team (EY)_  
Built a classification model using XgBoost with a `precision` of 0.87 to predict the attrition probability of each employee 
for the future financial year based on historic data like performance rating, appraisals, leaves taken and employee 
demographics.  

**Process Improvement : DMAIC {POC}**
Improved existing business process using DMAIC principles and reduced entire process flow by 40%. Developed a 
Machine Learning model using IBM Data Science Experience to predict the status and average time required to fix a 
newly raised defect using Logistic and Linear Regression. Also ran a survival analysis on time to closure for an open 
ticket.
