### **PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE**
_EY GBS, Bengaluru |2018-present|_ 
_IBM India Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru |2016-2018|_
 
**Client Performance Analytics {Alteryx, R, PowerBI}**

**IT Ticket analysis and root cause analysis**  
_Identify key trends and insights from short description and other details_  
Worked on text details of every tickets to bring out key insights and trends by leveraging techniques like NLP, text  similarity, topic modelling like LDA and NMF. Trend analysis of each topic of tickets was carried out in Power BI.  

**GIG Optimization (Contract workers effective utilization)** 
_Create a workflow on how to effectively utilize benched gigs to other open contracts_  
Built a python recommendation model in identifying talents for open contracts based on task-skill and gig skill mapping. Workflow was based on CV(count vectorizer) + similarity matrix model using cosine and avr cosine similarity

**Attrition Prediction: HR Analytics  { R, Alteryx, PowerBI , Power Automate }**  
_Predict attrition of employees in a financial year for BMC-team (EY)_ 
Built a classification model using RandomForest with a precision of 0.87 to predict the attrition probability of each employee for the future quarter based on historic data like performance rating, appraisals, leaves taken and employee demographics.
